Appendix A. Free/Libr√© and Open Source Software (FLOSS)
=======================================================

FLOSS is based on the concept of a community, which itself is based
on  the  concept  of  sharing, and particularly the sharing of
knowledge.   FLOSS   are  free  for  usage,  modification  and
redistribution.

If you have already read this book, then you are familiar with FLOSS
as well since you have been using Python all along!

If you want to know more about FLOSS, you can explore the following
list. I have listed some big FLOSS as well as those FLOSS which are
cross-platform (i.e. work on Linux, Windows, etc.) so that you can
try  using  these software without the need to switch to Linux
immediately although you eventually will ;-)

* Linux.  This is a FLOSS operating system that the whole world is
  slowly embracing! It was started by Linus Torvalds as a student.
  Now, it is giving competition to Microsoft Windows. The latest
  2.6 kernel is a major breakthrough w.r.t. speed, stability and
  scalability. [ Linux Kernel ]
* Knoppix.  This is a distribution of Linux which runs off just
  the CD! There is no installation required - you can just reboot
  your  computer,  pop the CD in the drive and start using a
  full-featured Linux distribution! You can use all the various
  FLOSS that comes with a standard Linux distribution such as
  running Python programs, compiling C programs, watching movies,
  etc. Then, reboot your computer again, remove the CD and use
  your existing OS, as if nothing happened at all. [ Knoppix ]
* Fedora.  This is a community-driven distribution, sponsored by
  Red Hat and is one of the most popular Linux distributions. It
  contains the Linux kernel, the KDE, GNOME and XFCE desktops, and
  the plethora of FLOSS available and all this in an easy-to-use
  and easy-to-install manner.
  If you care a complete beginner to Linux, then I would recommend
  that you try Mandrake Linux . The newly released Mandrake 10.1
  is just awesome. [ Fedora Linux, Mandrake Linux ]
* OpenOffice.org.  This is an excellent office suite based on Sun
  Microsystems'  StarOffice software. OpenOffice has writer,
  presentation, spreadsheet and drawing components among other
  things. It can even open and edit MS Word and MS PowerPoint
  files with ease. It runs on almost all platforms. The upcoming
  OpenOffice 2.0 has some radical improvements. [ OpenOffice ]
* Mozilla Firefox.  This is the next generation web browser which
  is predicted to beat Internet Explorer (in terms of market share
  only ;-) in a few years. It is blazingly fast and has gained
  critical acclaim for its sensible and impressive features. The
  extensions concept allows any kind of functionality to be added
  to it.
  It's companion product Thunderbird is an excellent email client
  that makes reading email a snap. [ Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla
  Thunderbird ]
* Mono.  This is an open source implementation of the Microsoft
  .NET platform. It allows .NET applications to be created and run
  on Linux, Windows, FreeBSD, Mac OS and many other platforms as
  well. Mono implements the ECMA standards of the CLI and C# which
  Microsoft, Intel and HP have submitted for standardization and
  they have now become open standards. This is a step in the
  direction of ISO standardization for the same.
  Currently, there is a complete C# mcs (which itself is written
  in C#!), a feature-complete ASP.NET implementation, many ADO.NET
  providers for databases and many many more features that are
  being improved and added everyday. [ Mono, ECMA, Microsoft .NET
  ]
* Apache web server.  This is the popular open source web server.
  In fact, it is the most popular web server on the planet! It
  runs nearly 60% of the websites out there. Yes, that's right -
  Apache handles more websites than all the competition (including
  Microsoft IIS) combined. [ Apache ]
* MySQL.   This is an extremely popular open source database
  server. It is most famous for it's blazing speed. More features
  are being added to it's latest versions. [ MySQL ]
* MPlayer.  This is a video player that can play anything from
  DivX to MP3 to Ogg to VCDs and DVDs to ... who says open source
  ain't fun? ;-) [ MPlayer ]
* Movix.  This is a Linux distribution which is based on Knoppix
  and runs off the CD but is designed to play movies! You can
  create Movix CDs which are just bootable CDs and when you reboot
  the computer and pop in the CD, the movie starts playing by
  itself! You don't even need a hard disk to watch a movie using
  Movix. [ Movix ]

This list is just intended to give you a brief idea - there are many
more excellent FLOSS out there, such as the Perl language, PHP
language, Drupal content management system for websites, PostgreSQL
database server, TORCS racing game, KDevelop IDE, Anjuta IDE, Xine -
the movie player, VIM editor, Quanta+ editor, XMMS audio player,
GIMP image editing program, ... this list could go on forever.
